# E-commerce Data Insight


I was assigned to work with an e-commerce company and asked to provide insights about the current situation based on the data given to do the following:
  1. Make a deck to explain the insight that you summarized from the data. Create clear visualizations in order to communicate the information effectively to the other team members and executives.
  2. The data given is still in raw data form. Please also explain the process of data preprocessing / data cleaning / data wrangling, from the beginning to ready-to-serve data in the deck.
